			<h2>"Engineers go to Germany."</h2>
			<p>“I became more intolerant to crowds,” replies Zakir when asked whether he has changed after living in Germany for five years.</p>
			<h3>Big City to Small Town</h3>
			<p>Born in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh and home to 15 million, Adullah Zakir Hussein moved to Ilmenau, the capital of Thuringia, in 2010 to study a Master in Computer Science. This town of 26 000 is known not only for its beautiful landscapes, but its University of Technology. Around 7000 students focus mainly on mathematics, physics and engineering and Zakir believes he was the only Bangladeshi studying there at the time. While the students were very friendly, some professors were too busy with their research to consider the background of their foreign students, making things challenging.</p>
			<p>The city is desolated with not many alternatives to student life. “The biggest concentration of people is to be seen in supermarkets,” he laughs. When not studying, he would spend his time reading novels and enjoying the nature. “There’s an excellent hiking trail where Goethe used to walk around. They say that if you don’t walk around there, you won’t pass your exams.”</p>

			<p>Forced to stop his studies to make ends meet, Zakir took up a full time engineering position in a “mittelständler” - a medium sized company which are still til today the core and pride of German industry. After a few years work under his belt, Zakir packed up to join the bustle of the Berlin startup scene.</p>
			<h3>Hardware to Software</h3>
			<p>Growing up in a small family of four, Zakir was introduced to electronics at the age of nine and has been fascinated ever since. He discovered computers at eighteen and chose to pursue his passion at university. “There’s not many engineering schools - most are for agriculture or literature. These days, people are becoming more interested in engineering because after doctors, it gives you the biggest chance for a decent life standard. But most people are still interested in becoming a doctor. My father was a doctor so I was supposed to be a doctor.“</p>
			<p>Zakir graduated with 25 others - 13 of them female. “One of my female classmates became a lecturer at the university. Most others became QA engineers.” He himself took a government job creating software to monitor import and export out of Dhaka. Working on software for the use of 50 000 people at the same time brought him to the realisation that there was still so much more to learn. “It made me realise that what I learnt from university was not enough. I learnt a lot from that project. I saved some money so i thought i should go overseas to learn more. My dad used to say: ‘Doctors go to the UK, engineers go to Germany’.”</p>
			<h3>Bangladesh</h3>
			<p>Bangladesh is a fast developing country, still living in the shadow of its neighbours. Ancient Bengal (first settlements date back to 4000 years ago) came to being as Bangladesh in 1971 as a result of the infamous war between India and Pakistan. Since then, the country has managed to lower its poverty level to 25% and double its per capita income. This rather tolerant country with an economy based on agriculture and gourmet production has to fight serious floods and typhoons as an effect of deforestation and climate change.</p>

			<p>Most work opportunities for engineers are still in outsourcing and the public sector and the tech scene is almost non existent. “I would like to find a job that has a really good project, which is impossible in Bangladesh. You can do some small projects to make some money, but it gets boring after the first six months.”</p>
			<p>“In Bangladesh, everything is very ad hoc. There’s no structure. In Germany, it’s all about measuring performance. If they see that something’s not performing very well, they will change something so performance is better. That wouldn’t happen in Bangladesh. People don’t care, people don’t even see these things, because most people don’t have an engineering background.”</p>
			<h3>Love for Tech</h3>
			<p>Zakir loves to talk about software.</p>
			<p>“Software is like a soul for computers. The software is operating the computer. If you press the power button on the computer, that means the soul is coming to the hardware. That’s very appealing. When you are making music or making a movie, it’s like making software. When you are writing software you are creating something. You are an artist.”</p>
			<p>He likes to see the way software can be used to improve the lives of people. “Java was mainly developed for large scale systems and now it’s used for blogs and newspapers, so this is very exciting for me. To see that whatever we are doing is contributing to the functionality and improvement of people’s lives, without them even realising it. I think the biggest power of technology is that it is happening without you knowing it.”</p>
			<p>What does the future hold for Zakir?</p>
			<p>“I want to learn as much as I can. I would like to work here for a few years at least. I would like to get a deep backend job where I can get experience doing a lot of things with a lot of people in a large project. Then I will figure out what to do with that expertise.”</p>
